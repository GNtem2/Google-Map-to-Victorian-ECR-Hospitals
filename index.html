Welcome to the simulated maps for emergency clot retrieval stroke
services provision in metropolitan Melbourne. These interactive maps
display the region serviced by a hospital under various service models
- i.e. number of hospitals. Links at the top of this page allow access
to maps displaying different service models. 

Please note that these maps were based on estimates of travel time
from random addresses to the major hospitals using Google Maps and
were not based on real ambulance transits.
