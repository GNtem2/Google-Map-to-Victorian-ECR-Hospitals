# How to use this site

This site contains a series of maps displaying hospital catchment areas for
various hospital configurations at four times of the day.

Maps can be interactively panned and zoomed using the on-screen buttons
or by using the mouse (click and drag and scroll). Clicking on a marker
will identify the hospital. Clicking on a pale yellow contour line will display
the travel time in minutes to the nearest hospital.

There is a side bar on each map that displays a different time of day.

The side bar on the "all models" map also selects different hospital
configurations.
