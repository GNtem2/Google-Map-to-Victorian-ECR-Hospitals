Seems tricky to get all the pieces to fit together, so this is a bit
hacky.

I'm using Rmd to create pages combining maps and text. Hoewever
I've done this using html fragments so that github can stick headers
and styles on.

This means there are some steps that tack the github style headers,
plus javascript stuff.

The markdown needs to be creating non selfcontainted html, because
pandoc doesn't know how to fetch the fonts. However it also doesn't
create the <script > entries.

Find out what the script entries should be by running:

htmlwidgets::saveWidget(map.2all, "m.html", selfcontained=FALSE)

There could be issues with versions of leaflet stuff, so watch out.
These <script> entries go in _layouts/default.html


Will use tack the front matter on using bash or R.

## The html files are created using 

make

which calls R using the compile.R script.

Changes to the Rmd files will require a recompile and commiting the changed html files to github
(as well as the changed Rmd files)
